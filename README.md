# Toot-and-Otto-Game 
Introduction to Programming in Java, Spring 2018

Created a modified Toot and Otto game that is played on a grid. There are two players, T and O. T goes first. A player choose a column that is not filled, and places their letter at the bottom most unfilled row in that column. Then the other player plays. If OTTO is ever created (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally then player O wins. If TOOT is ever created (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), then player T wins. 

The game is implemeted in Java and uses the JavaFX package. 

The game has the option for the player to choose the size of the board. To choose the size of the board, enter the dimensions of the board as arguments when running the program. The default board size when there are no arguments is 6x6.
