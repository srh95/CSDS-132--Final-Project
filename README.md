# Toot-and-Otto-Game 

Created a modified Toot and Otto game that is played on a grid. There are two players, T and O. T goes first. A player choose a column that is not filled, and places their letter at the bottom most unfilled row in that column. Then the other player plays. If OTTO is ever created (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally then player O wins. If TOOT is ever created (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), then player T wins. 

The game is implemeted in Java and uses the JavaFX package.
